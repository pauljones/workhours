Design me  a JSON database to collect first name and last name, employer's ID, course the employer taught, the date of teaching, and how many hours the employer taught, how much the employer is paid per hour. The output must show how many types of courses the employer taught in a week, in a month, and how much he should be paid. Also design me a javascript code and/or html code to implement this database.
Here's a JSON database schema to collect the required information:

```json
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "employerID": "12345",
      "coursesTaught": [
        {
          "courseName": "Mathematics",
          "date": "2024-05-01",
          "hoursTaught": 10,
          "hourlyRate": 20
        },
        {
          "courseName": "Physics",
          "date": "2024-05-02",
          "hoursTaught": 8,
          "hourlyRate": 20
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "employerID": "54321",
      "coursesTaught": [
        {
          "courseName": "Biology",
          "date": "2024-05-01",
          "hoursTaught": 12,
          "hourlyRate": 25
        },
        {
          "courseName": "Chemistry",
          "date": "2024-05-03",
          "hoursTaught": 6,
          "hourlyRate": 25
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- Each employee object contains their first name, last name, employer ID, and an array of courses they've taught.
- Each course object within the array includes the course name, date of teaching, hours taught, and hourly rate for that specific course.

Now, here's a JavaScript code snippet to calculate the required outputs:

```javascript
// Assuming data is the JSON object containing the database

function calculateCoursesPerWeek(employee) {
  const coursesPerWeek = {};
  employee.coursesTaught.forEach(course => {
    const date = new Date(course.date);
    const week = date.getFullYear() * 100 + date.getWeek();
    if (!coursesPerWeek[week]) {
      coursesPerWeek[week] = new Set();
    }
    coursesPerWeek[week].add(course.courseName);
  });
  return Object.keys(coursesPerWeek).length;
}

function calculateCoursesPerMonth(employee) {
  const coursesPerMonth = {};
  employee.coursesTaught.forEach(course => {
    const date = new Date(course.date);
    const month = date.getFullYear() * 100 + date.getMonth() + 1;
    if (!coursesPerMonth[month]) {
      coursesPerMonth[month] = new Set();
    }
    coursesPerMonth[month].add(course.courseName);
  });
  return Object.keys(coursesPerMonth).length;
}

function calculateTotalPayment(employee) {
  let totalPayment = 0;
  employee.coursesTaught.forEach(course => {
    totalPayment += course.hoursTaught * course.hourlyRate;
  });
  return totalPayment;
}

// Example usage:

data.employees.forEach(employee => {
  console.log(`${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}:`);
  console.log(`Courses taught per week: ${calculateCoursesPerWeek(employee)}`);
  console.log(`Courses taught per month: ${calculateCoursesPerMonth(employee)}`);
  console.log(`Total payment: $${calculateTotalPayment(employee)}`);
});
```

This code calculates the number of courses taught per week, per month, and the total payment for each employee based on the provided database schema.
